## Requirements for Completion
Version 1.0.0 of the render engine is complete and ready to be bundled into a release. It may still require more updates in the future as I come to better understand the things that will be required of it by other parts of the engine.
- [x] First working prototype
- [x] Vulkan implementation
- [x] OpenGL implementation
- [x] Add basic shading
- [x] Merged implementation
  - [X] Rewrite Vulkan render engine implementation (Work will never be done on this front)
  - [x] Integrate bare-bones OpenGL implementation
  - [x] Finish OpenGL integration
- [ ] Cleanup
  - [ ] Remove Vulkan SDK requirement (Might be delayed for some time)
  - [ ] Bring the code up to stylistic standards
